  <h1>What do I wanna do with my life?</h1>

  <p>Over the years i've started to grow up, and by growing up
    I have realized that i need to sort out things <strong>quickly</strong>
    because life is not really that <em>easy</em> you know? and things are 
    going well for me right now, yeah, but I can't be financially depending on
    my parents to much.
  </p>
  
  <h1>How am I going to do it?</h1>

  <p>This has actually been on my mind for a while you know?, just how can I
    be <strong>dependant</strong> on my own, how can I finally be
    <em>financially</em> stable and get out of my parent's house.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>I mean if we're talking about honesty, maybe is because i don't like
    being bossed around, but I know that is good for me you know?, maybe i'll 
    get over it one day, actually i don't think so, since the reason why i'm
    writing this is because I wanna move out
  </p>

  <h3>When?</h3>

  <p>Right now i'm just trying to learn coding so I can use it as a skill 
    to get a job so I can move out, but I promised myself i'd do it at or before
    18, so I have to put in the work in order to be able to do that.
  </p>
